Materials
=========

Materials are stored in .material files, and accompanied by .texset and .texture files in
Hedgehog engine 1 games.

Usually, materials are automatically imported as part of a model or similar, but if you just
want to edit one or multiple material files, you can do so by importing them directly.

	If you just want to import materials into your project without automatically adding them to
	any model open :ref:`the importer <bpy.ops.heio.import_material>`, select your
	file(s) to import, configure the import properties and then confirm.

	To import materials to a specific object, first select the object that the materials should be
	imported to (must be a mesh), then open
	:ref:`the importer from the specials <bpy.ops.heio.import_material_active>`,
	select your file(s) to import, configure the import properties and then confirm.

Texture images during import
----------------------------

Images are stored as .dds files.

Those used by materials can also be imported; If ``Import images`` has been disabled in the import
properties, or an image file was not found / could not be read, the addon creates a 16x16
placeholder texture in its place based on the connection of the template material.


Models
======

Models are stored in ``.model`` files, and are imported as armatures with one or more meshes. Models
consist of mesh units, each of which references a material by name. HEIO will try to import those
automatically when importing models.

Usually models are imported standalone, but can also be part of a ``.pcmodel`` file.

.. dropdown:: How to import .model files
	:icon: download

	Open :ref:`the importer <bpy.ops.heio.import_model>`, select your
	file(s) to import, configure the import properties and then confirm.

Terrain models
--------------

Terrain models, stored in ``.terrain-model`` files, are nearly identical to models, with only 3 differences:

- They have no armature, and thus no weights
- They have no morph models
- They have an internal resource name and special flags

While they too can be imported standalone, they are usually part of ``.pcmodel`` files (HE2) or
referenced by ``.terrain-instanceinfo`` files (HE1) (not yet supported)

.. dropdown:: How to import .terrain-model files
	:icon: download

	Open :ref:`the importer <bpy.ops.heio.import_terrain_model>`, select your
	file(s) to import, configure the import properties and then confirm.

Collision meshes
================

Collision meshes, specifically HE2 bullet meshes, are stored in ``.btmesh`` files.

Collision meshes usually part of a ``.pcmodel`` file, but can also be imported standalone.

.. dropdown:: How to import .btmesh files
	:icon: download

	Open :ref:`the importer <bpy.ops.heio.import_collision_mesh>`, select your
	file(s) to import, configure the import properties and then confirm.

Point Clouds
============

Point clouds are responsible for

- Placing stage geometry (``*.pcmodel``)
- Placing stage collisions (``*.pccol``)
- Placing stage light (``*.pclt``) (not yet supported)

When imported, HEIO will also attempt to import the referenced resource files, such as

- ``*.pcmodel``: ``*.terrain-model``, ``*.model``
- ``*.pccol``: ``*.btmesh``
- ``*.pclt``: ``*.light`` (not yet supported)

.. dropdown:: How to import .pcmodel / .pccol files
	:icon: download

	Open :ref:`the importer <bpy.ops.heio.import_point_cloud>`, select your
	file(s) to import, configure the import properties and then confirm.
