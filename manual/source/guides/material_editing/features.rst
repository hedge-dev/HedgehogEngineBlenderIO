	  - Bone deformation
	  - Enables bone influence on vertices

	* - c
	  - Cubemap
	  - Use `cube mapping <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping>`_ for reflection textures, instead of `spherical environment mapping <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d9/spherical-environment-mapping>`_
